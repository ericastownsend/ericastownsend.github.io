<h3>who i am</h3>
I am a behavioral neuroscientist that also happens to be a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth Psychological and Brain Sciences Department</a> working with <a href="https://smith-lab.org/">Dr. Kyle Smith</a>. I am fascinated by how quickly and effortlessly we can learn associations in our environment. It's how we are able to navigate our noisy, loud world. It's how we decide what to do or act. 

I study the neural transmission underlying learning and motivation mechanisms in the brain, as well as the complex and variable behaviors (specifically, Pavlovian conditioned approach, or sign-tracking) that manifest. Behavior is my bread and butter, and I strongly believe that without behavior the brain is just a ball of jelly. I developed some novel measures for studying motivated behaviors in animals with greater detail and in multiple dimensions. I'm hoping to capture individual differences and natural variation as well. I have been combining these analyses with in vivo pharmacology and fiber photometry to explore underlying dopamine and acetylcholine transmission in different frameworks of learning and motivation mechanisms in the brain. I've also had a chance to dabble a bit in the habit learning world with optogenetics and electrophysiology during my graduate endeavors.  

Besides science, I'm a huge foodie and I love to cook elaborate meals that I can pair a nice wine with (I took a wine tasting class in another life). I play five instruments, but my favorite is the flute. I am also a former barre instructor, so I'm always on the hunt for a fun fitness class. 


<h3>who i was</h3>
I'm originally from the DC metropolitan area, and went to Virginia Tech (go Hokies!) for my 2 bachelor's degrees in Cognitive & Behavioral Neuroscience and Psychology. I graduated in 2020. I was a part of Dr. Daniel English's lab, working on hippocampal microcircuits, place cell tuning, and spatial navigation using optogenetics and in vivo electrophysiology. I had a brief stint in neurogenetics and ultrasonic vocalizations in Dr. J. Michael Bowers' lab, as well as autism in nonverbal children with Dr. Angela Scarpa.
