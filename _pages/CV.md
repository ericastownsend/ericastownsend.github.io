Erica Townsend, B.S. Erica graduated magna cum laude from Virginia Tech in 2020 with degrees in Cognitive & Behavioral Neuroscience (B.S.) and in Psychology (B.S.). While at Virginia Tech, she studied the neurogenetics of language production disorders and their resulting early-life behaviors in the lab of Dr. J. Michael Bowers, as well as the role of hippocampal interneurons in pyramidal place cell tuning and spatial navigation in the lab of Dr. Daniel English. Her current research explores the contributions of the nucleus accumbens microcircuitry on cue-driven motivation and the flexibility of sign-tracking behaviors in dynamic environments using pharmacology and fiber photometry.
