Just had a paper accepted at <a href="https://learnmem.cshlp.org/">Learning & Memory</a>! It documents my latest work, creating a new procedure for detailed behavioral analysis. I hope it inspires behavioral neuroscientists to pursue more quality behavioral measures so we can better understand the brain.
Hopefully it will be out soon!
