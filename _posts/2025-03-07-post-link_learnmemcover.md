<a href="https://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/32/3/a054065.abstract">My latest work</a> with Dr. Kyle Smith is officially out in Learning and Memory and was <a href="https://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/32/3.cover-expansion">featured on the cover</a> with art by one of my students, Angela Shang. How lovely!
